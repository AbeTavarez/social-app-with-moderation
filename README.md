![alt text](moderation-ai-app.png "Logo Title Text 1")

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Cloning the project

First run the clone command:

```https://github.com/AbeTavarez/social-app-with-moderation```

Then cd into the project folder and run:
```npm i```

You also need to create a .env.local file and 
add the following environment variables with your own values from Supabase and OpenAI:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Done, now run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
